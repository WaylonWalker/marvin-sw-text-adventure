Your mission has been completed
Kara tries to recruit some fresh help before leaving Coruscant. She reaches out 
to her contacts and tries to find some skilled pilots and fighters to join her 
team. However, due to the recent increase in Imperial activity on the planet, 
most of her contacts are either lying low or have already been captured by the 
Empire. Kara decides to leave Coruscant with her current team and resources, 
hoping that they will be enough to complete the mission.

Your mission has been completed
Kara and her team successfully infiltrate the Imperial Shipyard on Kuat, using 
their skills and experience to avoid detection and take out any Imperial troops 
in their way. However, they are unable to siphon fuel from any of the ships in 
the shipyard, as the Imperial forces have taken extra precautions to secure 
their resources. Despite this setback, Kara and her team gather valuable intel 
on the new type of Star Destroyer being built at the shipyard, and transmit the 
information back to the Rebel Alliance. During the mission, they sustain some 
injuries and lose some health, but they are ultimately successful in completing 
their objective.
